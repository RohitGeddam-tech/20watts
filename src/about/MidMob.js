                Cyril's spent the past 21 years establishing his credentials in
                Management, Creative & Production. He has created branded
                content for Radio, Television & Digital while working with the
                likes of the TOI’s Entertainment unit, Red FM, Channel V and
                more. His last stint with O4 Digital - Group M, led to him
                breaking barriers on the digital platform. He has now blended
                his content and production expertise with technology, allowing
                him to be the creative firepower of 20 watts.

                Growing up, V wanted to be an intergalactic charades champion.
                But once he found out that Intergalactic council doesn’t take
                vernacular guys in the championship, he gave up on the dream and
                started telling everyone that careers are a 21st century
                invention. Now he is a part time shutter-bug, part time
                paint-thumb and a full time story-teller. (Yes he will tell you
                one even if you aren’t interested). He hates the word Creative
                in any designation so they make sure to keep adding it next to
                his name. If you ever want to have a long, meaningless chats
                about meaning of life, do ping him. Just not on weekdays please,
                he will probably have those chats instead of working and WE ARE
                NOT OK WITH IT!

                writing has been the longest and most fulfilling one. P.S. When
